# Password Manager üóÉ

## What is this all about? üí¨
This is a small scale OSS project to practice with and make something that might look cool on a resume üìù.<br>


## What you need to know:
- This app is written in Python 3.9. 
- Main purpose of this program \[currently\] is to act as a web integrated and mobile, random password generator. (Just for fun why not? üôà)
 
- I've chosen to use [`FastApi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as our API framework for the backend python functionality. but at some point Id like to make a [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/) version too. (Maybe someone can commit? üë•)

### Usage:
- see [`FastApi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for in depth api details.
- Ensure you have a *local virtual environment* setup and `pip install -r requirements`.
- navigate to the **src** folder and run the following command:
    - `uvicorn main2:app --reload`
- This will start a locally hosted server at **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)**
- Google Chrome or Firefox can be used to open the above URL.
- you can then make requests to the api by specifying a url with parameters if need be.
- To see what requests can be made navigate to the `/docs` page where you will be greeted with the beautiful **swaggerUI**.
- To see the endpoints navigate to to the `/password` page where you will find the API output
- If you are curious about how the raw OpenAPI schema looks like, FastAPI automatically generates a JSON (schema) with the descriptions of all your API.
